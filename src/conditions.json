	"flow0": "Sorry but this river is bone dry. Try a spring fed river like the San Marcos til we get more rain.",
	"flow1": "The river is pretty much just a trickle right. Not much good for floating at the moment but a good rain should bring it up",
	"flow2": "It's barely moving but it should be floatable in kayaks or tubes. Be prepared to drag bottom in spots though.",
	"flow3": "This is a pretty leisurely flow but still fun. You shouldn't have any problems scraping bottom in canoes at this level",
	"flow4": "Now we're talking! The river is flowing pretty good but not too dangerous. If the graph shows a sharp increase over the past week it may still be rising.",
	"flow5": "The flow is moving now! Unless this is a large volume river like the Colorado or Rio Grande you can expect some really fast moving water.",
	"flow6": "DANGER! Possible death awaits! Unless this is a large volume river like the Colorado you may drown. Check with a local outfitter for more details on conditions before heading out."
